## Installing

You will need Git and Python 3.5 or higher.
Clone the repository and install python dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/bluppfisk/coindicator.git
 cd coindicator
 ./install.sh
```

## Upgrading from 1.x

User data has moved to your home folder. To keep your settings, move the user.conf file to: **~/.config/coindicator/**.

## Running

* A launcher icon "Coindicator" should be installed that can be used to start the app
* Alternatively, run `./run.sh` to activate the virtual environment and start the app
* You can also run the program manually with `source bin/activate` and then run `coin/coin.py &` or `python3 coin/coin.py &` to start the app

## Configuring

Use the GUI to add and remove indicators (find the piggy icon), to pick assets, to set refresh frequency and to set alarms. Alternatively, edit the **user.conf** YAML file in the project root.

`max_decimals`: default 8. Lower if you want fewer decimals (takes priority over `significant_digits`)
`significant_digits`: default 3. Set to higher if you want more significant digits.

## Extending (Plug-ins)

Adding your own exchange plug-in is easy. Just create class file with methods for returning a ticker URL, a discovery URL, and parsing the responses from the ticker and discovery APIs. Then add the file to the `exchanges` folder.

Have a peek at the existing plug-ins (e.g. **kraken.py**) for an example and don't forget to contribute your plug-ins here on GitHub!
